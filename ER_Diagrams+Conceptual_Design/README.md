# Entity Relationship Diagrams and Conceptual Design
#### Design an E/R diagram for geography, write SQL tables to translate E/R diagram, with key constraints, and relationships, such as many to one relationship or many to many relationship. Decompose relational schemas into BCNF. Create tables for data from [MrFrumble](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse344/mrFrumbleData.txt) and find nontrivial functional dependencies in the database.

###### SQLite, a software library which implements a SQL database engine. 
###### Use sqlite3 on Mac OS X / Linux terminal.
###### Interesting info: no need to create a relational schema for many to one relationship. ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ
