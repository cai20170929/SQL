# Parallel Data Processing, Spark SQL and AWS
#### Write queries of Spark SQL which are executed in a distributed manner in AWS cloud, queries are on a relational flights database, entire data from [the Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time).
#### The database consists 4 tables of flights in 2015: Flights, Carriers, Months and Weekdays.

###### [AWS: Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
###### [Spark SQL](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/rdd-programming-guide.html)

###### Interesting info: if use AWS free plan or student coupon, always pay attention to close clusters and take a look of billing after finishing using, or you'll be charged a lot, cloud service is expensive though. T^T
